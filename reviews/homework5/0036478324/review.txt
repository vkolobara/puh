HOMEWORK

TASK 1
move function has non-exhaustive patterns. You should output an error message or do nothing if a wrong command is present.

If you had written move as:
move :: Robot -> Char -> Robot,
the simulate function could simply be:
simulate = foldl move

TASK 2
Maybe the code would be more readable with guards.

TASK 4
It is actually possible to make splitter work on infinite lists.

Here is my foldr function:

f x acc = if sublst `isPrefixOf` (x:curr) then []:drop len (x:curr):rest else (x:curr):rest

curr = current part, rest = following parts, len = length sublst

If we find the sublist as the prefix of our current part, then we need to split there and create a new empty part, else we just do another iteration where we prepend current element to the current part.
